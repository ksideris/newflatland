Latest iteration of flatland
---------------------------

Todo : 

1. TODO : (erase gameover letters) Clients need to properly restart after a reset has been raised
2. Add documentation
3. DONE! Clients could be smoother (maybe something in the update?)
4. DONE!  Benchmark networking, see how that goes, especially for phones (something is wrong on Macs)
5. NO NEED-> test with positions been updated by the server
6. investigate whether it is possible to initialize phone clients with an ssh command
7. DONE! fix annoying mining effect
8. DONE, BUT SCANNING IS NOT PERFECT YET! in scanning, there needs to be more synchronization between client/server.although this could be an issue from 3
8. REMOVE BUILDINGS COMPLETELY AFTER DESCTRUCTION
